# Elevate 🚀
**A Progress & Streak Maintainer Application**

Elevate is a progress streak maintainer application designed to help users **visualize consistency, discipline, and long-term growth** through intuitive progress representations. The app focuses on making progress **visible, motivating, and actionable**.

All core features of Elevate are designed to work **not only inside the application but also through Home Screen Widgets**, allowing users to track progress at a glance without opening the app.

This project is currently **in active development**. The core UI and architecture are in place, with multiple powerful features planned for future iterations.

---

## ✨ Core Concept

Users can create and maintain **streaks** for habits, goals, or activities. Each streak visually grows over time, helping users stay consistent and motivated.

Elevate offers **multiple progress visualization styles**, allowing users to choose how they want to track their progress.

## 📊 Progress Representation Formats

Users can set streaks using **three different progress formats**:

1. **Circular Progress Bar**  
   Ideal for habit completion and daily goals.

2. **Linear Progress Bar**  
   Best for milestone-based or long-term tracking.

3. **Grid Progress Bar**  
   A calendar-style visual representation of progress over time.

Each configured streak appears on the **Home Screen** once submitted.

## 🔄 Progress Update Modes

Elevate supports **two types of progress updates**:

### 1️⃣ Manual Update
- User opens the application
- Taps a button to increase the streak
- Full control over when progress is updated

### 2️⃣ Automatic Update
Progress updates automatically **once per day**, based on user preference:
- **Start of the Day**
- **End of the Day**

This allows streaks to grow without requiring daily manual interaction.
